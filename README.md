# Localization-using-monocular-camera-
Localization is a fundamental challenge in robotics â€” enabling a robot to know 
its position and orientation within an environment. Traditional approaches rely 
on costly sensors like LiDAR, GPS, or stereo vision, which may not be feasible in 
all conditions (e.g., GPS-denied areas or cost-sensitive robots). 
This project addresses the problem of achieving reliable localization using only 
a monocular camera with the help of machine learning techniques. The main 
challenge is that a single camera provides only 2D images without depth, 
making localization difficult. By applying ML/DL models, the system can 
estimate depth, motion, and trajectory from image sequences to enable 
efficient and low-cost localization.
